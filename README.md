Anticipate consumption needs of buildings

To achieve its goal of a carbon-neutral city by 2050, the city of Seattle closely examines the consumption and emissions of non-residential buildings.

Detailed surveys were conducted by city officials in 2016; however, obtaining these surveys is costly. Building on the existing data, the aim is to predict CO2 emissions and total energy consumption for non-residential buildings where these metrics have not been measured yet.

The prediction will be based on the structural data of the buildings (size and usage of buildings, construction date, geographical location, etc.).

The interest of the "ENERGY STAR Score" for predicting emissions, which is cumbersome to calculate with the current approach, needs to be assessed. It will be integrated into the modeling, and its utility will be evaluated.

Mission

Conduct an exploratory analysis.

Test various prediction models to best address the issue.
